# Airport-Database
Database that I developed with a partner for CMPT307 to help Aiports keep track of valuable information like Destination, Flight Time, Seat Capacity of a plane, etc. I chose to have this assignment in my portfolio because it demonstrates my ability to work with a partner and collabrate. When we built the database, Southwest Airlines was having major issues with their system and flights were getting cancelled. Our idea was to fix this and build a database! We used Python and SQL to do so.
